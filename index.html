     <p> Mayor de Blasio implemented his traffic safety program, “Vision Zero,” in 2014 with the goal of eliminating traffic-related fatalities and injuries in the five boroughs. Since the implementation of Vision Zero, de Blasio claimed that traffic-related fatalities have seen a steady decrease. An analysis of data on motorist vehicle collisions -- in which at least one pedestrian was killed -- shows that since Vision Zero began, while traffic-related pedestrian deaths have mostly declined overall, the decline has not been a consistent downward trend. 2015 was the deadliest year for pedestrians in Brooklyn, and 2016 saw the most pedestrian deaths in Queens. </p>

		<p> Traffic safety has been a major issue in Brooklyn, where there have been the most pedestrian fatalities overall since the implementation of Vision Zero. Craig Hammerman, a traffic safety guru who formerly managed the community board 6 of “Brownstone Brooklyn,” says that there is still work to be done regarding traffic safety, especially in Southern Brooklyn where he currently lives. He chalks the high fatality rates up to a few different factors, including the high number of motorists, and the large amount of “undedicated asphalt” that is not designated for cyclists or pedestrians, necessarily. “Brooklyn needs to be put on a roadway diet,” said Hammerman. “Our streets lack ‘safe street’ design.”
